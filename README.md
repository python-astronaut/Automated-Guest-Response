# Automated-Guest-Response 
This is a Command-line application to create and manage templates for common hotel guest communications. 

So while I was working at the front desk one time, I noticed our team was sending out over 100 emails a day. Most of them were the same things. Booking confirmations, Pre arrival emails, follow ups after guests checked out. It was nonstop, and honestly, it felt like such a waste of time and energy.

So one night, back at staff accommodation, I decided to write this program. I ended up putting together a command line program. It’s dead simple. It uses a set of JSON templates — just prewritten emails with placeholders for the details that change, like the guest’s name or check-in date. customizeable and there is fuctionality build in where I could automated the process and create a pipeline. 

Also I was thinking about automating an api call into the program. So that you could actually have custom emails lines build in maybe 1-2 sentances as personalized emails can be annoying at times. That said this is free to use at your discretion just please site me when doing so however this is open software. Below are some screenshots of it working if you were curious.

Enjoy :)
