# Automated-Guest_response 
This is a Command-line application to create and manage templates for common hotel guest communications. 

So while I was working at the front desk one time, I noticed our team was sending out over 100 emails a day. Most of them were the same things. Booking confirmations, Pre arrival emails, follow ups after guests checked out. It was nonstop, and honestly, it felt like such a waste of time and energy.

So one night, back at staff accommodation, I decided to write this program. I ended up putting together a command line program. It’s dead simple. It uses a set of JSON templates — just prewritten emails with placeholders for the details that change, like the guest’s name or check-in date. customizeable and there is fuctionality build in where I could automated the process and create a pipeline. 

Also I was thinking about automating an api call into the program. So that you could actually have custom emails lines build in maybe 1-2 sentances as personalized emails can be annoying at times. That said this was submitted to my boss which I believe is still using it today. :)
